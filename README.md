# FacialEmotionRecognition

This is a fun project created for face detection and emotion recognition. Application wise we could use this idea or even advanced version of these for but not limited to :

1. Security and Surveillance
2. Customer Analytics
3. Patient Monitoring
4. Driver Monitoring
5. Attendance Management( I personally would hate this though!)
6. Student Engagement
7. Interactive Experiences (for gaming ... I would definitely love adjusting dynamics of the game with change in expressions of players )
8. Criminal Investigations
9. Identity Verification
10. Recruitment : Behaviour patterns duing interviews could give insights on persons' suitablity for roles.
