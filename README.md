# FacialEmotionRecognition

This is a fun project created for face detection and emotion recognition. Application wise we could use this idea or even advanced version of these for under mentioned areas:

1. Security and Surveillance
2. Customer Analytics
3. Patient Monitoring
4. Driver Monitoring
5. Attendance Management( I personally would hate this though! 😠😠😠)
6. Student Engagement
7. Interactive Experiences (for gaming ... I would definitely love adjusting dynamics of the game with change in expressions of players 😲😲 )
8. Criminal Investigations
9. Identity Verification
10. Recruitment : Behaviour patterns duing interviews could give insights on persons' suitablity for roles.

## Requirements
```
pip install streamlit opencv-python 
```

## Running it
```
streamlit run facereg_v3.py
```
## Disclaimer
Majority of the code is taken from opencv and Modified using prompt engineering and debugged manually which were not fixed by prompting.
Lot of bugs and optimisation issues might be there. This is just a helper code. Have fun!
